# Assignment 3 - Tara Boulanger (7922331)
(primarily the same as A2 readme)
### Platform details:
I am running this on a Windows 10 PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core  Processor with 3.70 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.

### A+ feature:


### Other notes:
I used example8, lots from example0, the assignment 1 sample solution and parts from my assignment 2 solution as a base example for both my curves and shader files.

<br> The shader code is very similar to what is in example 0, just with some variable names changed for my own personal understanding. 
<br> It would appear as though the sand is only filling vertex-by-vertex which I know is incorrect, but I could not figure out how to get it to fill only by each pixel.
<br> It may also be worth noting that there is a bit of a "zipper" along each side of the hourglass as it is connecting between the next vertices. I could not figure out how to get them to connect with glDrawElements, sadly.
