# Assignment 3 - Tara Boulanger (7922331)

### Platform details:
I am running this on a Windows 10 PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core  Processor with 3.70 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.

### A+ feature:
I ran out of time for implementing the A+ feature. However, the skeleton code for the triangle that was going to be moving along the curves remains. All of the functions with the words "lilman" in it is to symbolize the triangle going along the curves, and I was calling it that just to make light of implementing an A+ feature.

### Other notes:
I used parts of my assignment 2 solution as a base example for both my curves files.

<br> I used the following link to help me understand uniform cubic b-spline curves. I mostly use their method of thinking of separating each part of the parametric equation into separate functions, but I apply it in my own way. https://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~anima/UniformBSpline.pdf
